        <h2>Project List</h2>

        <h3>Project 1</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Name: Evolutionary and demographic consequences 
                    of temperature-induced masculinization under climate warming: 
                    the effects of mate choice</li>
                <li>Description: One of the dangers of global climate change to wildlife is 
                    distorting sex ratios by temperature-induced sex reversals in populations where sex determination is not exclusively genetic, potentially leading to population collapse and/or sex-determination system transformation. Here we introduce a new concept on how these outcomes may be altered by mate choice if sex-chromosome-linked 
                    phenotypic traits allow females to choose between normal and sex-reversed (genetically female) males </li>
                <li>Program: Biology</li>
                <li>Year: 2020</li>
            </ul>

         <h3>Project 2</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Name: Gamification in transportation 
                    and mobilities: a preliminary overview of scientific literature</li>
                <li>Description: A systematic literature review on scientific literature was conducted
                     on the objectives of gamification in transportation 
                     and mobilities. The computer science field has mainly addressed this rapidly growing research area so far. Nevertheless inputs from human factors and ergonomics (HF/E) are crucial in 
                    order to ensure that gamification meets the needs,
                     expectations and constraints of humans in their mobility. </li>
                <li>Program: Computer Science</li>
                <li>Year: 2018</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Project 3</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Name: Deep learning approach to Hubble parameter</li>
                <li>Description: The main purpose of this work is to show that machine learning algorithms (MLAs) can be 
                    used to improve the abilities of cosmological models and to make meaningful astrophysical predictions </li>
                <li>Program: AstroPhysics</li>
                <li>Year: 2021</li>
            </ul>
